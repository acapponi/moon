# The problem

Mora, my poodle, was diagnosed with Canine distemper virus when she was a puppy. This virus degenerates the nervous system, leaving lasting signs such as seizures and tics.

When she started with the symptoms our vet told us to be more alert on full moons, as she could be prone to have more seizures on those days.

I've been collecting data on every event she has, and as I was always exceptical of this I wanted to see if it was true.

Thanks for watching!
